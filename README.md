# DSA Practices

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository, this repository is my personal space to practice problem-solving, enhance my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and store solutions to related problem

The solutions are organized into topic-based folders, with subfolders for difficulty levels.

```

### Example:

- `arrays/easy/two-sum.js`: Solution for the "Two Sum" problem.
- `graphs/hard/shortest-path-in-weighted-graph.js`: Solution for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GiangThanhDat/dsa-practices.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```bash
   cd dsa-practices/arrays/easy
   ```
3. Run the solution:
   ```bash   
   node solution.js     # For JavaScript
   ```

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

1. A practice platform to improve problem-solving skills.
2. Deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.  
3. A collection of reference solutions categorized by topic and difficulty.
4. A resource for anyone preparing for coding interviews.
3. Keep an organized record of solutions for future reference and growth.
